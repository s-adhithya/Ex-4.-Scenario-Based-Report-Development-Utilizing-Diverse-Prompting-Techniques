# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.

## Aim:
To The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.

## Algorithm:
1.Define Objective

Set the goal of building a chatbot for handling retail customer inquiries.

2.Collect Data

Gather FAQs, customer support logs, product catalogs, and synthetic queries.

3.Preprocess Data

Clean, normalize, and annotate queries with intents, slots, and sentiments.

4.Design Prompts

Create system prompts, zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and retrieval-augmented prompts.

5.Develop Prototype

Integrate prompts into a chatbot using an AI model API (e.g., GPT, Claude, Bard).

6.Test Chatbot

Run sample customer queries and log chatbot responses with metadata.

7.Evaluate Performance

Measure intent accuracy, slot extraction F1 score, response latency, and escalation rate.

8.Human Review

Assess clarity, tone, and helpfulness of responses on a rating scale.

9.Analyze Results

Compare performance across different prompting techniques and identify errors.

10.Refine & Report

Improve prompts, retrain if needed, and generate a structured multi-page report with findings and recommendations.
## Prompt:
You are tasked with designing an AI-powered chatbot for the retail industry. The chatbot should handle order tracking, returns, refunds, and product recommendations while maintaining a polite and empathetic tone. Use various prompting techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and retrieval-augmented generation to test performance. Collect and annotate data from retail FAQs, customer logs, and simulated queries. Evaluate results using intent accuracy, slot F1, latency, and customer satisfaction metrics. Compare prompt strategies to identify strengths and weaknesses. Provide detailed analysis, findings, and recommendations. Finally, generate a professional multi-page report summarizing the full experiment.
